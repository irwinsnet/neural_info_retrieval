      " '11 at 0:40add a comment1 Answer active oldest votesup vote2down voteaccepted350F is the magic temp. Just about every casserole cooks at 350, and you cook it until it starts being bubbly which will probably between 30 minutes and an hour (in this case, you should check to make sure it's hot in the center as well, since you're starting from frozen). I'd cover it early, and then uncover it near the end so the top won't get dry.share improve this answeranswered May 31 '11 at 0:06Satanicpuppy12k 27\n"

The conversations children are expected to take part in - classroom discourse - are much different from the conversations they may have at home. Conversations at home are generally with familiar people in cosy surroundings in an environment they know well. In essence, the language is contextualized. That is, a child learns language skills in a familiar place, doing well known activities. An example would be a young child helping mum do the dishes. The child learns about plates, cups, saucers and other kitchen items by being immersed in and talking with his/her parent about their environment. The child uses the context of the kitchen to more freely commit any new words - about kitchen items - to memory. In the school classroom, language is \n"
