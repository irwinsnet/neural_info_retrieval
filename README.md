## Workflow
### 2. Split Documents into Passages
The documents from the MSMARCO document and the query documents must be
split into individual passages before they can be submitted to the
DeepCT prediction step. Tools and guidance are in the
[doc_split_deepCT folder](https://github.com/sirwin31/neural_info_retrieval/tree/main/doc_split_deepCT)
