# neural_info_retrieval
Summer 2021 capstone project for Wang, Khural, Irwin, and Holmes

## Workflow
### 1. Generate Dataset from DocT5query
Nogueira et. al. generated 10 queries for every document in the MSMarco
document data set and made these queries available online. We aggregated
the queries for each document into a dataset nearly identical to the
MSMARCO dataset. They query dataset contains the MSMARCO document ID, URL,
and title. The only difference is that the original text has been replaced
with the queries generated by docT5query. The pthon code that generated
the query dataset is in the
[create_qeury_docs folder.](https://github.com/sirwin31/neural_info_retrieval/tree/main/create_query_docs)

### 2. Split Documents into Passages
The documents from both the MSMARCO document and the query documents must be
split into individual passages before they can be submitted to the
DeepCT prediction step. Tools and guidance are in the
[doc_split_deepCT folder](https://github.com/sirwin31/neural_info_retrieval/tree/main/doc_split_deepCT)

### 3. DeepCT Prediction with MSMARCO and docT5Query Documents

### 4. Generate Dataset File for Converting DeepCT Weights to HDCT Weights
