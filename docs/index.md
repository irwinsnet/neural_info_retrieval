## Welcome to TRESPI 
## What is TRESPI
TRESPI stands for TRansformers for Expansion of SParse Indexes. It is the end product of our research project. 

## Who are we 
We are UC Berkeley MIDS program students: Wade Holmes, Manpreet Khural, Stacy Irwin, Joanna Wang
## Research Question
We want to uknow can we help a user or institution find docuemnts faster by returning the best document in the top position of results. It is imortant because index based retrieval is core to even the most advanced multi-stage retrieval systems today.  Small improvements in these systems have a material effect on the technology experience and performance. So our research question is: **Can document indexes for information retrieval incorporate context AND be supplemented to address vocabulary mismatch measured by document return rank?**

## Project Description 

For our project, we attempted to get the best of both worlds by combining the HDCT model ([Dai and Callan's HDCT GitHub](https://github.com/AdeDZY/DeepCT)) and DocT5query ( [Nogueira and Lin GitHub](https://github.com/castorini/docTTTTTquery) ) model. We built two document indexes. Both index were generated from the MSMARCO Document dataset using HDCT. One index was generated using the standard HDCT framework. The other index was generated from documents comprised solely of queries generated by docT5query. The two indexes were then combined into a single index. Our goal is to have an inverted index that reflects a term's importance within a document, but can also match query terms that are related to a document's topic but that do not appear in the document. We named our approach TRansformers for Expansion of SParse Indexes, or TRESPI.
